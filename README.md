## Learning_Django

- This very basic API in Django. We will not use any model, we are trying to learn about post method and how to get back the results (how to give url in postman) from postmam/thunderbird. 

#### Steps:
- Create a project:
django-admin startproject myproject
Here myproject is my project name. This command will create a folder myproject--> myproject

- Create an App:
You have to make an app where your manage.py is. My manage.py is in myproject folder, so run this command there.
python manage.py startapp basic_api

Here basic_api is my app name.

- Create a urls.py in your app, because we need to integrate it with the urls.py in our project.
